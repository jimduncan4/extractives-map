Dashboard for mapping the extractive industries of Ghana

This project is an subset of the [Mapping for Results][] project [code][m4rcode] that focuses on the extractives industry. This includes a lot of logic that handles mapping countries, extractives, government spending and more. The code could be easily streamlined to specific functionality just for the Extractive Industries.
